# SEPLN-TweetLID14

The TweetLID shared task consists in identifying the language or languages in which tweets are written. Focusing on events, and news in the Iberian Peninsula, the main focus of the task is the identification of tweets written in the 5 top languages from the Peninsula (Basque, Catalan, Galician, Spanish, and Portuguese), and English

We will provide the participants of the task with a training corpus that includes approximately 15,000 tweets manually annotated with the language(s). The participants will have a month to develop and tweak their language identification systems from this training corpus. They will have apply their system on the test set afterwards, and submit the output of the system, which will be evaluated and compared to the other participants’ systems.

It is worth noting that some tweets are written in more than one language (e.g., partly in Portuguese, and partly in Galician), and that the language cannot be determined in some cases (e.g., “jajaja”). The corpus also takes into account these specific cases, providing annotations such as “ca+es” (written in Catalan and Spanish), “ca/es” (it can be either Catalan or Spanish, it does not make a difference in this case), “other” (it is written in a language that is not considered in the task), o “und” (when it cannot be determined).
